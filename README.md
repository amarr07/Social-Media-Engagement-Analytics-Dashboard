## Data Requirements

### Performance Data (File 1)
| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Page Name | Name of page/profile/channel | "Tech News Daily" |
| Post ID | Unique post identifier | "POST_001" |
| Date | Post publication date | "2024-01-15" |
| Likes | Number of likes | 150 |
| Comments | Number of comments | 25 |
| Shares | Number of shares | 10 |

### Previous Period Data (File 2)
| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Page Name | Name of page/profile/channel | "Tech News Daily" |
| Total Posts | Number of posts in previous period | 45 |
| Total Engagement | Total engagement in previous period | 5000 |

### Follower Data (File 3)
| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Page Name | Name of page/profile/channel | "Tech News Daily" |
| Followers | Current follower count | 15000 |

## Engagement Formula

```
Engagement = (1 √ó Likes) + (2 √ó Comments) + (3 √ó Shares)
```

This weighted formula prioritizes:
- **Shares** (weight: 3) - Highest value, indicates strong engagement
- **Comments** (weight: 2) - Medium value, indicates conversation
- **Likes** (weight: 1) - Base value, indicates acknowledgment

## Output Metrics

The dashboard calculates and displays:

1. **Rank**: Position based on total engagement (1 = highest)
2. **Page/Profile/Channel**: Name of the page
3. **Followers**: Current follower count
4. **Total Posts**: Number of posts in current period
5. **Total Engagement**: Sum of engagement scores for all posts
6. **Days Won**: Number of days this page had highest engagement
7. **% Change Posts**: Percentage change in posts vs. previous period
8. **% Change Engagement**: Percentage change in engagement vs. previous period

## Day-wise Winner Logic

For each day:
1. All posts are aggregated by page and date
2. Engagement is summed for each page on that date
3. The page with highest engagement wins that day
4. Winner gets +1 to their "Days Won" count

## Tips for Best Results

- Ensure date columns are properly formatted (YYYY-MM-DD or Excel date format)
- Use consistent page/profile names across all three files
- Numeric columns (likes, comments, shares) should contain only numbers
- Remove any header rows beyond the first row
- Check for and remove any merged cells in Excel files

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Error loading file"
- **Solution**: Ensure file is .xlsx or .xls format, not corrupted

**Issue**: Columns not auto-detected
- **Solution**: Manually select the correct columns from dropdowns

**Issue**: Missing data in results
- **Solution**: Verify page names match exactly across all three files

**Issue**: Percentage changes show as 0%
- **Solution**: Ensure previous period data contains valid numeric values

## Example Files

The repository includes three example files:
- `exampleupload1.xlsx`: Sample performance data
- `exampleupload2.xlsx`: Sample previous period data
- `exampleupload3.xlsx`: Sample follower data

Use these to test the application and understand the required format.

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check that all required packages are installed
2. Verify Python version is 3.8 or higher
3. Ensure all three files are uploaded before mapping columns
4. Review the instruction.md file for detailed specifications
