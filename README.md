## Data Requirements

### Performance Data (File 1)
| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Page Name | Name of page/profile/channel | "Tech News Daily" |
| Post ID | Unique post identifier | "POST_001" |
| Date | Post publication date | "2024-01-15" |
| Likes | Number of likes | 150 |
| Comments | Number of comments | 25 |
| Shares | Number of shares | 10 |

### Last Fortnight Data (File 2)
| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Page Name | Name of page/profile/channel | "Tech News Daily" |
| Engagement | Total engagement from last fortnight | 5000 |
| Post Count | Number of posts in last fortnight | 45 |
| Day Won | Days won in last fortnight | 3 |
| Rank | Rank in last fortnight | 2 |

### Follower Data (File 3)
| Column | Description | Example |

## Engagement Formula

```
Engagement = (1 √ó Likes) + (2 √ó Comments) + (3 √ó Shares)
```

This weighted formula prioritizes:
- **Shares** (weight: 3) - Highest value, indicates strong engagement
- **Comments** (weight: 2) - Medium value, indicates conversation
- **Likes** (weight: 1) - Base value, indicates acknowledgment

## Output Metrics

The dashboard calculates and displays:

1. **Follower**: Current follower count (with tooltip)
2. **Page/Profile/Channel**: Name of the page (with tooltip)
3. **Post**: Number of posts in current period (with tooltip)
4. **Engagement**: Sum of engagement scores for all posts (with tooltip)
5. **Rank**: Current ranking based on total engagement (1 = highest) (with tooltip)
6. **Day Won**: Number of days this page had the highest engagement (with tooltip)
7. **% Change in Post**: Percentage change in posts vs. last fortnight (with tooltip)
8. **% Change in Engagement**: Percentage change in engagement vs. last fortnight (with tooltip)
9. **Last Fortnight Day Won**: Days won in the last fortnight period (with tooltip)
10. **Last Fortnight Rank**: Ranking in the last fortnight period (with tooltip)

## Day-wise Winner Logic

For each day:
1. All posts are aggregated by page and date
2. Engagement is summed for each page on that date
3. The page with highest engagement wins that day
4. Winner gets +1 to their "Days Won" count

## Tips for Best Results

- Ensure date columns are properly formatted (YYYY-MM-DD or Excel date format)
- Use consistent page/profile names across all three files
- Numeric columns (likes, comments, shares) should contain only numbers
- Remove any header rows beyond the first row
- Check for and remove any merged cells in Excel files

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Error loading file"
- **Solution**: Ensure file is .xlsx or .xls format, not corrupted

**Issue**: Columns not auto-detected
- **Solution**: Manually select the correct columns from dropdowns

**Issue**: Missing data in results
- **Solution**: Verify page names match exactly across all three files

**Issue**: Percentage changes show as 0%
- **Solution**: Ensure previous period data contains valid numeric values

## Example Files

The repository includes three example files:
- `exampleupload1.xlsx`: Sample performance data
- `exampleupload2.xlsx`: Sample previous period data
- `exampleupload3.xlsx`: Sample follower data

Use these to test the application and understand the required format.

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check that all required packages are installed
2. Verify Python version is 3.8 or higher
3. Ensure all three files are uploaded before mapping columns
4. Review the instruction.md file for detailed specifications
